  <title>The Circle</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we study the circle — one of the most important shapes in all of mathematics.
      You first met circles in primary school, where you learned to name their parts and calculate
      their circumference and area. Here we take a deeper look: we define the circle precisely as a
      <em>set of points</em>, explore its geometric properties, and learn how to work with circles
      on the coordinate plane using algebra.

      <em>Recall</em> from primary school that a circle is a perfectly round shape.
      You learned to identify its <term>centre</term>, <term>radius</term>, and
      <term>diameter</term>, and you used the formulas for circumference and area:

  <!-- SUBSECTION 2: The Definition of a Circle                  -->
  <!-- ======================================================== -->

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-circle-definition">
    <title>What is a Circle?</title>

    <p>
      In primary school you thought of a circle as a round shape.
      Now we need a precise definition — one that tells us exactly
      which points belong to the circle and which do not.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-circle">
      <title>Circle (Appendix B, Definition 40)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>circle</term> is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance
          (its <term>radius</term>) from a fixed point (its <term>centre</term>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      <em>Appreciate</em> what this definition says: a circle is <em>not</em> the filled-in
      region — it is only the boundary. The filled-in region is called the
      <term>disc</term>. Every point on the circle is <em>exactly</em> the same distance from
      the centre. This idea of equidistance is the key property of the circle and
      underlies everything we do in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it this way: if you tie a piece of string to a pin stuck in a board and
      pull the string taut with a pencil, every point the pencil can reach traces out a
      circle. The pin is the centre, and the length of the string is the radius.

    <p>
      <em>Identify</em> the following terms. Each is defined precisely in
      Appendix B (Definition 40 and surrounding material) of the specification.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-circle-parts">
      <title>Circle Terminology</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>s</m> be a circle with centre <m>O</m> and radius <m>r</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>radius</term> (plural: <term>radii</term>) is any line segment joining
          the centre to a point on the circle. Its length is <m>r</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>chord</term> is a line segment joining any two points on the circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>diameter</term> is a chord that passes through the centre.
          Every diameter has length <m>2r</m>. This number is also called the
          diameter of the circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> on a circle divide it into two pieces
          called <term>arcs</term>. A <term>semicircle</term> is an arc whose endpoints are
          the endpoints of a diameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>sector</term> is the region enclosed by an arc and the two radii
          to its endpoints (like a "slice of pizza").
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>disc</term> is the region inside the circle. Its area is <m>\pi r^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>circumference</term> is the total length around the circle:
          <m>C = 2\pi r = \pi d</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-tangent">
      <title>Tangent to a Circle (Appendix B, Definition 42)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A line <m>l</m> is called a <term>tangent</term> to a circle <m>s</m>
          when <m>l</m> meets <m>s</m> in exactly one point. That point is called
          the <term>point of contact</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-tangent-perpendicular">
      <title>Tangent–Radius Theorem (Appendix B, Theorem 20)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, if <m>P</m> lies on a circle and a line through <m>P</m> is perpendicular
          to the radius at <m>P</m>, then that line is a tangent.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      This theorem is extremely important for exam questions that ask you to
      <em>find the equation of a tangent</em>. The method is: find the slope of the
      radius, then the tangent slope is the negative reciprocal.

    <title>Key Circle Theorems</title>

    <p>
      The following results from Appendix B are part of the Leaving Certificate
      Ordinary Level course. You should be able to <em>use</em> them to solve problems,
      even though you are not asked to reproduce their proofs in the exam.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-angle-at-centre">
      <title>Theorem 19 — Angle at the Centre</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The angle at the centre of a circle standing on a given arc is
          <em>twice</em> the angle at any point of the circle standing on the same arc.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <corollary xml:id="cor-angles-same-arc">
      <title>Corollary 2 — Angles on the Same Arc</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All angles at points of the circle, standing on the same arc, are equal.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>

    <corollary xml:id="cor-angle-semicircle">
      <title>Corollary 3 — Angle in a Semicircle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each angle in a semicircle is a right angle. That is, if <m>BC</m> is a diameter
          of a circle and <m>A</m> is any other point of the circle, then
          <m>\angle BAC = 90°</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>

    <corollary xml:id="cor-right-angle-diameter">
      <title>Corollary 4</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the angle standing on a chord <m>[BC]</m> at some point of the circle is
          a right angle, then <m>[BC]</m> is a diameter.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>

    <p>
      Corollary 3 appears frequently in exam questions. If you see a triangle inscribed
      in a circle where one side is a diameter, the angle opposite that diameter is
      automatically <m>90°</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-circle-equation">
    <title>The Circle on the Coordinate Plane</title>

    <p>
      We now connect the geometric definition to algebra.
      <em>Recall</em> the definition: a circle is the set of all points at distance <m>r</m> from
      a centre <m>(h, k)</m>. If <m>(x, y)</m> is any point on the circle, the distance from
      <m>(x, y)</m> to <m>(h, k)</m> equals <m>r</m>. Using the distance formula:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>\sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2} = r</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Squaring both sides gives us the standard equation.
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-circle-equation">
      <title>Equation of a Circle</title>
      <p>
        The circle with centre <m>(h, k)</m> and radius <m>r</m> has equation:
      </p>
      <p>
        <me>(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2</me>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <me>x^2 + y^2 = r^2</me>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      <em>Appreciate</em> that this equation is simply the distance formula in disguise.
      Every point <m>(x, y)</m> satisfying the equation is exactly <m>r</m> units from the centre.
      This is entirely consistent with Definition 40.

        Given an equation like <m>(x - 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 49</m>, you can immediately
        <em>identify</em> the centre as <m>(3, -4)</m> and the radius as <m>\sqrt{49} = 7</m>.

    <p>
      <alert>Key Definitions:</alert>
      A <term>circle</term> is the set of all points at a given distance (the radius) from
      a fixed point (the centre). The filled region is the <term>disc</term>.
      A <term>tangent</term> is a line meeting the circle at exactly one point.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Key Theorems:</alert>
      The tangent at any point is perpendicular to the radius at that point (Theorem 20).
      The angle in a semicircle is a right angle (Corollary 3).
      All angles standing on the same arc are equal (Corollary 2).
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Key Formula:</alert>
      The circle with centre <m>(h, k)</m> and radius <m>r</m> has equation
      <me>(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Key Skills:</alert>
      Write the equation given centre and radius;
      read centre and radius from the equation;
      verify whether a point is on/inside/outside the circle;
      find the equation of a tangent;
      use circumference and area formulas in context.
