    <title>To the Student</title>

    <p>You are capable of understanding mathematics.</p>

    <p>If it has ever felt confusing or fragmented, that experience does not define you. It simply means the structure was not made visible.</p>

    <p>This book begins with simple ideas, arranged carefully. Each chapter builds from what came before it. Nothing appears without reason. Nothing is expected before it has been discovered.</p>

    <p>You will see patterns before formulas. You will explore before formalising. You will ask what changes, what stays the same, and what must be true.</p>

    <p>Mathematics is not about speed. It is about clarity.</p>

    <p>You are here to understand.</p>

    <title>To the Teacher</title>

    <p>This book is linear by design.</p>

    <p>The order of ideas is intentional and cumulative. Concepts are introduced informally, strengthened through use, and formalised only when the structure is ready.</p>

    <p>Students may revisit foundations when needed. Stronger students may extend beyond the core development. The structure is stable; the pace remains yours.</p>

    <p>The aim is durable understanding. Examination success should follow naturally from that.</p>

    <title>Why This Book Is Needed</title>

    <p>As a student, I was drawn to pattern and structure. Physics revealed an ordered world <mdash/> systems that could be described clearly and precisely.</p>

    <p>But when the mathematics behind that world became demanding, I realised my foundations were not as deep as I had believed. I had learned procedures, but I had not fully seen how the ideas connected.</p>

    <p>Years later, returning to mathematics as a teacher and learner, I discovered something simple and powerful: it was the foundations that mattered most.</p>

    <p>Working carefully through basic ideas <mdash/> sometimes more deeply than before <mdash/> revealed how reliable and transferable they were. The language mattered. Definitions mattered. Small distinctions mattered.</p>

    <p>The simplicity of well-understood mathematics is not trivial. It is strong.</p>

    <p>This book is built on that belief: when foundations are clear, everything else grows naturally.</p>

    <p>The goal is not to move quickly. The goal is to understand well.</p>
