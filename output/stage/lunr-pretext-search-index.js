  "body": " To the Student  You are capable of understanding mathematics.  If it has ever felt confusing or fragmented, that experience does not define you. It simply means the structure was not made visible.  This book begins with simple ideas, arranged carefully. Each chapter builds from what came before it. Nothing appears without reason. Nothing is expected before it has been discovered.  You will see patterns before formulas. You will explore before formalising. You will ask what changes, what stays the same, and what must be true.  Mathematics is not about speed. It is about clarity.  You are here to understand.  "

Concepts are introduced informally, strengthened through use, and formalised only when the structure is ready.  Students may revisit foundations when needed. Stronger students may extend beyond the core development. The structure is stable; the pace remains yours.  The aim is durable understanding. Examination success should follow naturally from that.  "

  "title": "Why This Book Is Needed",
  "body": " Why This Book Is Needed  As a student, I was drawn to pattern and structure. Physics revealed an ordered world systems that could be described clearly and precisely.  But when the mathematics behind that world became demanding, I realised my foundations were not as deep as I had believed. I had learned procedures, but I had not fully seen how the ideas connected.  Years later, returning to mathematics as a teacher and learner, I discovered something simple and powerful: it was the foundations that mattered most.  Working carefully through basic ideas sometimes more deeply than before revealed how reliable and transferable they were. The language mattered. Definitions mattered. Small distinctions mattered.  The simplicity of well-understood mathematics is not trivial. It is strong.  This book is built on that belief: when foundations are clear, everything else grows naturally.  The goal is not to move quickly. The goal is to understand well.  "

  "title": "Synthetic Geometry",
  "body": " Synthetic Geometry   Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics — the ancient Greeks built it up from a handful of basic ideas into an extraordinary logical structure. In this section, we follow that same path. We start with a few terms so basic they cannot be defined, state a few truths so fundamental they cannot be proved, and then build everything else from there.  At Leaving Certificate Ordinary Level, you are expected to solve problems using the theory. No proofs are examinable. But understanding the logical structure — what follows from what — is what makes the difference between memorising and truly knowing geometry.       The Language of Geometry   Undefined Terms  Every system of knowledge has to start somewhere. In mathematics, we begin with ideas so primitive, so fundamental, that we cannot define them using simpler ideas — because there are no simpler ideas. These are our undefined terms .  Here are the ones you need right now. We will introduce more as we need them.   Our Starting Undefined Terms    Term  What we mean (informally)    Point  A location. It has no size, no width, no length — just position. We label points with capital letters: , , .    Line  A straight path that extends forever in both directions. It has no thickness. A line through points and is written .    Plane  A flat surface that extends forever in all directions. All our geometry takes place in one fixed plane.    Real number  The numbers on the number line. We use them to measure distances and angles.     Notice: we described these terms, but we did not define them. You will not be asked for a definition of point in an exam — it is one of our starting points (no pun intended). You can think of a point as a dot on a page, but really even a dot has size. A mathematical point is an idealisation: pure location, nothing more.  As we go further, we will meet more undefined terms — angle , degree , length , set — introduced on a need-to-know basis.    Defined Terms  Once we have our undefined terms, we can start building. A defined term is a new concept described precisely using terms we already have. For example, once we know what point and line mean, we can define what a segment is.  We will introduce defined terms as we need them throughout this section. The important ones include: segment, ray, midpoint, triangle, angle, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, parallelogram, circle, tangent, chord , and many more.    Axioms, Theorems, and the Rest  Here is the hierarchy of mathematical truth:   The Logical Hierarchy    Term  What it means    Axiom  A statement we accept as true without proof. Our starting assumptions — the rules of the game.    Theorem  A statement we prove is true, using axioms and previously-proven theorems.    Proof  A logical argument that shows a theorem must be true.    Corollary  A result that follows quickly and directly from a theorem.    Converse  The reverse of a theorem: swap the if and the then .    Implies  If the first statement is true, then the second must be true.     A word of caution about converses. Just because a theorem is true does not mean its converse is true. For example: Every square is a rectangle is true, but every rectangle is a square is false. Always check whether a converse actually holds before using it.        The Building Blocks  From our undefined terms, we immediately get our first definitions and our first axiom.   Axiom 1 — Two Points   There is exactly one line through any two given points.    This is beautifully simple. Pick any two points — there is exactly one line through them. Not zero, not two. Exactly one. We write for the line through and .   Points, lines, segments, rays, distance, and midpoint.   Diagrams showing a point, a line extending in both directions, a segment with two endpoints, a ray with one endpoint, distance notation, and a midpoint.     Segment   The line segment  is the part of line between and , including both endpoints.     Ray   The ray  starts at and passes through , extending forever beyond . The point is the endpoint of the ray.     Collinear Points   Three or more points are collinear if they all lie on a single line.     Triangle   If , , are three non-collinear points, the triangle  is the figure enclosed by the segments , , and . The segments are its sides and the points are its vertices .     Distance  We write for the distance between points and . This is also the length of segment .   Axiom 2 — Ruler   Distance has these properties:  1. (distance is never negative).  2. (same distance either way).  3. If lies on between and , then .  4. Given any ray from and any number , there is exactly one point on the ray at distance from .    Property 3 is the one you use constantly: if a point is between two others, the distances add up. Property 4 says you can always mark off a distance — essential for constructions.    Midpoint   The midpoint  of segment is the point on the segment with .         Angles  Angle is another undefined term. An angle has a vertex (a point), two arms (rays from the vertex), and an inside . We write for the angle at vertex with arms and , and for the number of degrees in the angle.   The five types of angle, and supplementary angles.   Diagrams showing acute, right, obtuse, straight, and reflex angles, plus supplementary angles that add to 180 degrees.     Types of Angle    Type  Degrees   Null angle  Acute angle Between and  Right angle Exactly  Obtuse angle Between and  Straight angle Exactly  Reflex angle Between and  Full angle     Axiom 3 — Protractor   Every angle has a degree measure between and . A straight angle is . Angles can be added: if ray is inside , then .     Supplementary Angles   Two angles are supplementary if they add to .     Perpendicular Lines   Two lines are perpendicular if they meet at a right angle ( ). We write .     Angle Bisector   The ray is the bisector of if .         Congruent Triangles  Two triangles are congruent if all six measurements match: three sides and three angles. But you do not need all six — three carefully chosen measurements are enough.   The three congruence conditions: SAS, ASA, SSS.   Three triangles showing the SAS, ASA, and SSS congruence conditions with matching sides and angles marked.     Axiom 4 — SAS, ASA, SSS   Two triangles are congruent if:  SAS: Two sides and the included angle are equal, or  ASA: Two angles and the included side are equal, or  SSS: All three sides are equal.    These are not theorems — they are axioms. We accept them as true. Everything about congruent triangles flows from here.   Types of Triangle (by sides)   A triangle is isosceles if two sides are equal, equilateral if all three sides are equal, and scalene if no two sides are equal.     Right-Angled Triangle   A triangle is right-angled if one angle is . The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse .         Parallel Lines   Parallel Lines   Two lines are parallel if they never meet (or are the same line). We write .     Axiom 5 — Parallels   Given any line and a point not on it, there is exactly one line through parallel to .    This is the last of our five axioms. Everything in geometry is built from Axioms 1–5 plus the definitions above.   Transversal, Alternate Angles, Corresponding Angles   A transversal is a line that crosses two other lines. Where it crosses, it creates alternate angles (on opposite sides, between the lines) and corresponding angles (on the same side, one at each crossing).     Alternate angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines.   Two parallel lines cut by a transversal, with alternate angles marked as equal.         The Junior Cycle Theorems (Assumed Knowledge)  These results were proved at Junior Cycle. At LC OL, they are assumed — you use them freely. We state each one with its diagram so you have a complete reference.   Theorem 1 — Vertically Opposite Angles   Vertically opposite angles are equal in measure.     Vertically opposite angles are equal.   Two lines crossing, with two pairs of vertically opposite angles marked in matching colours.     Theorem 2 — Isosceles Triangles   (1) In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal.  (2) Conversely, if two angles of a triangle are equal, the triangle is isosceles.     Equal sides imply equal base angles.   An isosceles triangle with two sides marked equal and the base angles marked equal.     Theorem 3 — Alternate Angles   If a transversal makes equal alternate angles on two lines, then the lines are parallel. Conversely, if two lines are parallel, any transversal makes equal alternate angles.     Theorem 4 — Angle Sum in a Triangle   The three angles in any triangle add to .     The angles in a triangle sum to 180°.   A triangle with its three angles labelled alpha, beta, gamma, and the equation alpha plus beta plus gamma equals 180 degrees.     Theorem 5 — Corresponding Angles   Two lines are parallel if and only if, for any transversal, corresponding angles are equal.     Theorem 6 — Exterior Angle   Each exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two interior opposite angles.     The exterior angle theorem.   A triangle with one side extended, showing the exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.     Theorem 9 — Parallelograms   In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and opposite angles are equal.     Theorem 10 — Diagonals of a Parallelogram   The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.     Parallelogram: opposite sides equal, diagonals bisect each other.   A parallelogram with opposite sides marked equal, diagonals drawn, and their intersection point marked.     Theorem 14 — Pythagoras   In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides: .     Theorem 15 — Converse of Pythagoras   If for the sides of a triangle, then the angle opposite side is a right angle.     Pythagoras: .   A right-angled triangle with the right angle marked, sides labelled a, b, c, and the formula.     Corollary 3 — Angle in a Semicircle   An angle standing on a diameter is a right angle.     Corollary 4   If the angle standing on a chord at a point of the circle is , then the chord is a diameter.     The angle in a semicircle is 90°.   A circle with a diameter and a point on the circumference forming a right angle.         Sides and Angles in a Triangle (Theorems 7 and 8)  Now we reach new territory for LC OL. These two theorems connect the sizes of sides and angles within a single triangle.   Theorem 7 — Bigger Side, Bigger Angle   (1) In , if , then .  In words: the angle opposite the longer side is the larger angle.  (2) Conversely, the side opposite the larger angle is the longer side.     The bigger the side, the bigger the opposite angle.   A triangle with sides of different lengths, the largest angle opposite the longest side.    Proof idea: Place a point on with . Then is isosceles, and combining the Exterior Angle Theorem with the Isosceles Triangle Theorem gives .  Think of it physically: a longer side needs to push the opposite angle wider to make room.   Theorem 8 — Triangle Inequality   Any two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third: .     The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.   A triangle showing the direct path from A to B is shorter than the detour via C.    This is the geometric way of saying: the shortest path between two points is a straight line. Any detour via a third point makes the journey longer.   Ordering Angles Using Theorem 7   In , , , . List the angles from smallest to largest.    Sides: .  Angles (opposite): .     Can a Triangle Have These Sides?   (a) 4, 6, 9 (b) 2, 3, 6 (c) 5, 5, 10    (a) . Yes.  (b) . No.  (c) , not strictly greater. No.     Practice   1. In , , , . Which angle is largest?  2. Two sides of a triangle are 5 and 11. Find the range of the third side.  3. Can a triangle have sides 7, 8, 14?    1. (opposite ).  2. .  3. Yes: .         Ratio and Similarity (Theorems 11, 12, 13)  These three theorems are the foundation for similar triangles.   Theorem 11 — Three Parallel Lines   If three parallel lines cut off equal segments on one transversal, then they cut off equal segments on any other transversal.     Equal spacing on one transversal gives equal spacing on any other.   Three parallel lines cut by two transversals, with equal segments marked on both.    Think of ruled paper: equally spaced horizontal lines. Any line drawn across the page crosses them at equal intervals, regardless of angle.   Theorem 12 — Line Parallel to Base   In , if a line parallel to cuts in the ratio , then it also cuts in the ratio .     A line parallel to the base divides both sides in the same ratio.   A triangle with line DE parallel to BC cutting sides AB and AC in the ratio s to t.     Theorem 13 — Similar Triangles   If two triangles are similar (all angles equal), their sides are proportional:     Similar triangles: same shape, proportional sides.   Two triangles of different sizes with matching angles and a scale factor arrow.     Using Theorem 12   in . , , . Find .    , so .     Similar Triangles   Two similar triangles have sides 6, 8, 10 and the shortest side of the second is 9. Find the other sides.    Scale factor . Sides: 9, 12, 15.

A side of the smaller is 10. Find the corresponding side of the larger.  3. A flagpole casts an 8 m shadow. A 1.7 m person nearby casts a 2 m shadow. Find the flagpole height.    1. .  2. Side ratio , so larger side .  3. m.         Area (Theorems 16, 17, 18)   Base, Apex, Height   Choose one side of a triangle as the base . The opposite vertex is the apex . The perpendicular distance from the apex to the line containing the base is the height (or altitude ).     Theorem 16 — Base × Height Is Constant   For a triangle, base × height does not depend on which side is chosen as the base.     Area of a triangle = ½ × base × height.   A triangle with base and height marked.     Theorem 17 — Diagonal Bisects Area   A diagonal of a parallelogram bisects its area.     Theorem 18 — Area of a Parallelogram   Area of a parallelogram = base × height.     Area of a parallelogram. The diagonal splits it into two equal triangles.   A parallelogram with base and height marked and a diagonal drawn.     Two Altitudes   with height 6. . Find the height from to .    Theorem 16: , so .     Parallelogram   has , height 8.

Circles: Tangents and Chords (Theorems 20, 21, Corollary 6)   Circle Terminology   A circle is the set of all points at a fixed distance (the radius ) from a fixed point (the centre ). A chord is a segment joining two points on the circle. A diameter is a chord through the centre. A tangent is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point — the point of contact .     Theorem 20 — Tangent ⊥ Radius   (1) A tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.  (2) Conversely, a line perpendicular to the radius at a point on the circle is a tangent.     Tangent ⊥ radius at the point of contact.   A circle with a tangent at P and radius OP, right angle marked.    Key habit: Whenever you see a tangent, draw the radius to the point of contact and mark the right angle. This unlocks Pythagoras.   Theorem 21 — Perpendicular from Centre Bisects Chord   (1) The perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord.  (2) The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre.     Perpendicular from centre bisects the chord.   A circle with chord AB and perpendicular from centre O to midpoint M.     Corollary 6 — Common Tangent   If two circles share a common tangent at one point, the two centres and that point are collinear.     Common tangent: centres and contact point are collinear.   Two circles with a common tangent, centres and contact point on the same line.     Tangent Length   Radius 5, . Find tangent length .    . .     Chord Distance   Chord length 24, radius 13.

A parallelogram : both pairs of opposite sides parallel. A rectangle : parallelogram with all right angles. A rhombus : parallelogram with all sides equal. A square : both a rectangle and a rhombus.    Every square is a rectangle is a parallelogram. But not every rectangle is a square.

At LC OL, you need to understand how enlargements affect lengths and areas, and be able to solve problems involving them.    Centre of Enlargement and Scale Factor  An enlargement is defined by two things:  1. A fixed point called the centre of enlargement .  2. A number called the scale factor , where and .  To enlarge a point about a centre with scale factor : the image lies on the ray such that .  Every point of the figure is transformed this way. Lines from the centre through corresponding points of the object and image are called rays of enlargement .   Effect of Scale Factor    Scale Factor  Effect  Example     Image is larger than the object  : every length is doubled     Image is the same size (identity)  No change     Image is smaller than the object (reduction)  : every length is one-third     Note: when , we still call it an enlargement even though the image is smaller. Some texts use the word reduction for this case.    Effect on Lengths  Under an enlargement with scale factor , every length in the image is times the corresponding length in the object:   This applies to all lengths: sides, diagonals, perimeters, heights, radii — everything.  Since the shape is preserved and only the size changes, the object and its image are similar figures . All corresponding angles are equal. All corresponding sides are in the ratio .

Area depends on two dimensions (e.g. base height). Each dimension is multiplied by , so the area is multiplied by .  For example, if a rectangle has base and height , its area is . After enlargement by factor , the base becomes and the height becomes , so the new area is .  This works for any shape — triangles, circles, irregular figures — because any area can be built up from triangles, and the argument applies to each one.

  "body": " The Circle   In this section we study the circle — one of the most important shapes in all of mathematics. You first met circles in primary school, where you learned to name their parts and calculate their circumference and area. Here we take a deeper look: we define the circle precisely as a set of points , explore its geometric properties, and learn how to work with circles on the coordinate plane using algebra.   Focus Questions   As you work through this section, aim to answer each of the following:   What is the precise mathematical definition of a circle?  What are the key parts of a circle and how do they relate to one another?  How do we write the equation of a circle with centre and radius ?  How can we determine whether a point lies on, inside, or outside a circle?  How do we find the equation of a tangent to a circle at a given point?        What You Already Know   Recall from primary school that a circle is a perfectly round shape. You learned to identify its centre , radius , and diameter , and you used the formulas for circumference and area:   Primary School Circle Formulas  For a circle with radius and diameter :         You also encountered the special number , which is the ratio of every circle's circumference to its diameter. These formulas remain essential — many Leaving Certificate questions ask you to calculate circumference or area as part of a larger problem.   Beginning Activity — Circle Recall   Test your recall of these primary-school ideas before moving on.     A circle has radius 6 cm. Calculate its diameter, circumference, and the area of the disc it encloses.    Use , , and .     cm, cm, cm .      A wheel has diameter 50 cm. Calculate how far the wheel travels in one complete rotation. Give your answer in metres.     cm m.       The Circle — Introduction        What is a Circle?  In primary school you thought of a circle as a round shape. Now we need a precise definition — one that tells us exactly which points belong to the circle and which do not.   Circle (Appendix B, Definition 40)   A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance (its radius ) from a fixed point (its centre ).     Appreciate what this definition says: a circle is not the filled-in region — it is only the boundary. The filled-in region is called the disc . Every point on the circle is exactly the same distance from the centre. This idea of equidistance is the key property of the circle and underlies everything we do in this section.  Think of it this way: if you tie a piece of string to a pin stuck in a board and pull the string taut with a pencil, every point the pencil can reach traces out a circle. The pin is the centre, and the length of the string is the radius.       Parts of a Circle   Identify the following terms. Each is defined precisely in Appendix B (Definition 40 and surrounding material) of the specification.   Circle Terminology   Let be a circle with centre and radius .  A radius (plural: radii ) is any line segment joining the centre to a point on the circle. Its length is .  A chord is a line segment joining any two points on the circle.  A diameter is a chord that passes through the centre. Every diameter has length . This number is also called the diameter of the circle.  Two points and on a circle divide it into two pieces called arcs . A semicircle is an arc whose endpoints are the endpoints of a diameter.  A sector is the region enclosed by an arc and the two radii to its endpoints (like a \"slice of pizza\").  The disc is the region inside the circle. Its area is .  The circumference is the total length around the circle: .     Tangent to a Circle (Appendix B, Definition 42)   A line is called a tangent to a circle when meets in exactly one point. That point is called the point of contact .     Tangent–Radius Theorem (Appendix B, Theorem 20)   Each tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact.  Conversely, if lies on a circle and a line through is perpendicular to the radius at , then that line is a tangent.    This theorem is extremely important for exam questions that ask you to find the equation of a tangent . The method is: find the slope of the radius, then the tangent slope is the negative reciprocal.       Key Circle Theorems  The following results from Appendix B are part of the Leaving Certificate Ordinary Level course. You should be able to use them to solve problems, even though you are not asked to reproduce their proofs in the exam.   Theorem 19 — Angle at the Centre   The angle at the centre of a circle standing on a given arc is twice the angle at any point of the circle standing on the same arc.     Corollary 2 — Angles on the Same Arc   All angles at points of the circle, standing on the same arc, are equal.     Corollary 3 — Angle in a Semicircle   Each angle in a semicircle is a right angle. That is, if is a diameter of a circle and is any other point of the circle, then .     Corollary 4   If the angle standing on a chord at some point of the circle is a right angle, then is a diameter.    Corollary 3 appears frequently in exam questions. If you see a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is a diameter, the angle opposite that diameter is automatically .       The Circle on the Coordinate Plane  We now connect the geometric definition to algebra. Recall the definition: a circle is the set of all points at distance from a centre . If is any point on the circle, the distance from to equals . Using the distance formula:     Squaring both sides gives us the standard equation.   Equation of a Circle  The circle with centre and radius has equation:      Special case: When the centre is the origin :       Appreciate that this equation is simply the distance formula in disguise. Every point satisfying the equation is exactly units from the centre. This is entirely consistent with Definition 40.   Reading an Equation  Given an equation like , you can immediately identify the centre as and the radius as . Watch the signs carefully: means .        Worked Examples  Each worked example below follows Pólya's four-step method: Understand the problem, Devise a plan, Carry out the plan, and Look back . Questions are drawn from actual Leaving Certificate exam papers.    Writing the Equation of a Circle   The circle has centre and radius 4. Write down the equation of .

In this section, we meet the four main number sets, understand how they are related, and learn to work fluently with each one. We also cover the essential skills: prime factorisation, order of operations, and scientific notation.       The Number Sets: , , ,  Each number set is contained inside the next, like nested boxes.   The four number sets, each containing the previous.   Nested rectangles showing N inside Z inside Q inside R, with examples of each type.     Natural Numbers   The natural numbers are the counting numbers: . They go on forever — there is no largest natural number.    With natural numbers alone, we can add and multiply freely. But we cannot subtract freely — has no answer in . This motivates our next set.   Integers   The integers include all natural numbers and their negatives: . The letter comes from the German word Zahlen (numbers).    Now subtraction always works. But division doesn't — is not an integer.   Rational Numbers   The rational numbers are all numbers that can be written as a fraction where and .    Every integer is rational (just put it over 1: ). Every terminating decimal is rational ( ). Every repeating decimal is rational ( ).  But there are numbers that are not rational.   Irrational Numbers   An irrational number is a real number that cannot be written as a fraction of integers. Its decimal expansion goes on forever without ever repeating.    The most famous irrational numbers are , , and . The ancient Greeks were shocked to discover that cannot be expressed as a fraction — it broke their assumption that all quantities were ratios of whole numbers.   Real Numbers   The real numbers are all the rational and irrational numbers together. They fill the entire number line with no gaps: .    The key relationship: . Every natural number is an integer, every integer is rational, every rational number is real. But not the other way around.  Since contains numbers that are not in (the irrationals), we write .   Different types of number on the number line.   A number line showing integers, rationals like one half and negative three halves, and irrationals like root two.     Classifying Numbers   Classify each number into its smallest number set: , , , , , , , .    (natural number).  (integer, not natural).  (rational, not integer).  (it simplifies to a natural number).  (irrational — 7 is not a perfect square).  (irrational).  (repeating decimal, so rational).  (rational, not integer).     Number Classification Practice   1. Classify: , , , , ,  2. True or false? (a) Every integer is rational. (b) Every rational number is an integer. (c) is irrational. (d) is rational because is close to it.  3. Give an example of a number that is: (a) in but not , (b) in but not , (c) in but not .    1. ; ; irrational; ; ; irrational (non-repeating).  2. (a) True. (b) False. (c) False ( ). (d) False ( is rational but is not).  3. (a) . (b) . (c) .         Rational and Irrational: The Decimal Test  How do you know whether a number is rational or irrational? The decimal expansion tells you everything.   Rational decimals terminate or repeat. Irrational decimals do neither.   A table comparing rational decimals (terminating or repeating) with irrational decimals (non-terminating, non-repeating).    The rule is simple:  A decimal that terminates (stops) or repeats (a block of digits recurs forever) is rational .  A decimal that goes on forever without any repeating pattern is irrational .   Converting a Repeating Decimal to a Fraction   Show that .    Let  Then  Subtract: , so , giving .     Working with Irrational Numbers  You can do arithmetic with irrational numbers using the surd rules from algebra. For now, the key facts are:  and .  Adding irrationals does not simplify in general: cannot be written as a single surd.  Sometimes an expression that looks irrational is actually rational: .    Simplifying Surds   Simplify: (a) (b) (c)    (a) .  (b) and , so the sum is .  (c) .     Practice   1. Convert to a fraction: (a) (b) (c)  2. Simplify: (a) (b) (c)  3. Is rational or irrational? What about ?    1. (a) . (b) . (c) .  2. (a) . (b) . (c) .  3. , irrational. , rational.         Operations: , , , Across the Number Sets  Some sets are closed under certain operations — the result always stays in the set. Others are not.   Closure of Operations    Set         Closed  Not closed  Closed  Not closed     Closed  Closed  Closed  Not closed     Closed  Closed  Closed  Closed*     Closed  Closed  Closed  Closed*     *Division by zero is never allowed in any set.  Not closed means you can find examples where the operation takes you outside the set. For instance, takes you out of into . And takes you out of into .  This is essentially why each larger set was invented — to make more operations possible.   Closure Examples   For each operation, state which set the result belongs to and whether it remains in the starting set: (a) in . (b) in . (c) in . (d) in .    (a) . Stays in.  (b) . Leaves .  (c) . Stays in.  (d) . Stays in (but is irrational).         Factors, Multiples, and Primes   Factor and Multiple   If (where ), then and are factors of , and is a multiple of both and .     Prime Number   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...  Note: 1 is not prime. And 2 is the only even prime.     Composite Number   A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not prime (i.e. it has factors other than 1 and itself).     Prime Factorisation  Every natural number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers in exactly one way (ignoring order). This is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic .  A factor tree is a handy way to find the prime factorisation. Start with the number, split it into any two factors, then keep splitting until every leaf is prime.    Factor tree for 360.   A factor tree breaking 360 down into its prime factors: 2 cubed times 3 squared times 5.     Prime Factorisation   Express in prime factor form: (a) 180 (b) 504 (c) 2025    (a) .  (b) .  (c) .     HCF and LCM  The Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both. Take the lowest power of each common prime.  The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) is the smallest number that both divide into. Take the highest power of each prime that appears in either factorisation.    HCF and LCM Using Prime Factors   Find the HCF and LCM of 180 and 504.    .  .  HCF: common primes at lowest powers = .  LCM: all primes at highest powers = .  Check: . ✓     Practice   1. Express in prime factor form: (a) 240 (b) 1764  2. Find the HCF and LCM of 240 and 360.  3. Two gear wheels have 36 and 48 teeth. After how many revolutions of the smaller wheel do both wheels return to their starting position?    1. (a) . (b) .  2. HCF = 120, LCM = 720.  3. LCM(36, 48) = 144. Smaller wheel: revolutions.         Order of Operations (BIMDAS)  When a calculation has multiple operations, the order matters. We follow a universal convention.   BIMDAS: the order of operations.   Six boxes spelling BIMDAS: Brackets, Indices, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract, with priority arrow from highest to lowest.    B rackets first. Then I ndices (powers and roots). Then M ultiply and D ivide (left to right — they have equal priority). Finally A dd and S ubtract (left to right — equal priority).   BIMDAS in Action   Evaluate:    (brackets first)  (indices)  (multiply)  (add, then subtract, left to right)     Nested Brackets   Evaluate:    (inner brackets)  (index)  (outer bracket)      Practice   Evaluate each expression:  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.    1. . 2. . 3. . 4. . 5. .         Decimals and Fractions: Two Sides of the Same Coin  Every decimal is a fraction in disguise. Understanding this connection deepens your number sense and is essential for estimation.  A decimal like is shorthand for . The denominator is always a power of 10, which is why we call it a base-10 system.   Place Value    Position  Hundreds  Tens  Units  .
