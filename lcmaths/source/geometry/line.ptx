          <introduction>
            <p>Before we begin co-ordinate geometry, we review some essential notation
            and ideas from Junior Cycle. Everything in this section builds on what you
            already know — we are simply making it more precise and more powerful.</p>

            <p>In co-ordinate geometry, we work with points, lines, and segments.
            The notation matters — it tells us exactly what we mean.</p>

            <title>What Is a Line?</title>

            <p>A line is a <em>set of points</em>. Every point <m>(x, y)</m> on the line
            satisfies the equation of that line. We call <m>(x, y)</m> a
            <term>variable point</term> — it can be any point on the line.</p>

            <p>By contrast, <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> is a <term>fixed point</term> — a known,
            specific point on the line. Think of it as an anchor or reference point.
            Much of co-ordinate geometry is about the relationship between a fixed
            point and a variable point on the same line.</p>

            <p>Given two points <m>P(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>Q(x_2, y_2)</m>, the
            <term>slope of line <m>PQ</m></term> is:</p>
            <me>m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</me>

            <p>Read this aloud: <q>the slope of line <m>PQ</m></q> — not just
            <q>the slope of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m></q>. The slope belongs to the
            <em>line</em>, not to the points.</p>
          </paragraphs>

          <paragraphs xml:id="par-slope-anatomy">
            <title>Anatomy of the Slope Formula</title>

            <p>Let us decompose the formula. The numerator <m>y_2 - y_1</m> is the
            <term>rise</term> — the vertical change. The denominator <m>x_2 - x_1</m>
            is the <term>run</term> — the horizontal change. So slope is:</p>
            <me>m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{\text{vertical change}}{\text{horizontal change}}</me>

            <p>Every line segment can be decomposed into a horizontal and a vertical
            component — a <term>supporting triangle</term>. The slope measures
            how these two components compare.</p>

            <p>This is a <em>relative comparison</em>. The subtraction means we
            don't care where the points are in absolute terms — only their position
            <em>relative to each other</em>. A line through <m>(1, 2)</m> and
            <m>(3, 6)</m> has the same slope as a line through <m>(101, 102)</m>
            and <m>(103, 106)</m>.</p>
          </paragraphs>

          <paragraphs xml:id="par-slope-properties">
            <title>Properties of Slope</title>

            <p><em>Is the slope formula commutative?</em> Yes. It does not matter
            which point you call <m>P</m> and which you call <m>Q</m>. If you
            swap them, both the numerator and denominator change sign, and
            <m>\frac{-(y_2-y_1)}{-(x_2-x_1)} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.</p>

            <p>However, <em>good practice</em> is to let the second point be the one
            further to the right. This way the run <m>(x_2 - x_1)</m> is positive,
            and the sign of the slope comes entirely from the rise. This makes it
            easier to see whether the line is increasing or decreasing:</p>

            <title>Connections to Junior Cycle</title>

            <p>The slope formula connects to several ideas from the Number strand
            (JC spec N.1):</p>

            <p><em>Decomposition:</em> We decompose the change between two points
            into a vertical part (rise) and a horizontal part (run). This is the same
            idea as decomposing numbers or operations into simpler parts.</p>

            <p><em>Commutativity:</em> We saw that the slope formula is commutative
            with respect to swapping points. This connects directly to the
            commutative property of multiplication and division of signed numbers
            (JC spec N.1b).</p>

            <p><em>Relative comparison:</em> Slope is a ratio. It uses subtraction
            to compare positions relatively, not absolutely (JC spec N.3a). The
            actual coordinates don't matter — only the <em>differences</em> do.</p>

            <title>Distance (Log Tables p. 18)</title>

            <p>The distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> is:</p>
            <me>|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}</me>

            <p>Read this as: <q>the square root of the sum of two squares</q>.
            The two squares are the rise squared and the run squared. This is
            Pythagoras applied to the supporting triangle.</p>

            <p><em>Is this formula commutative?</em> Yes — and for a stronger
            reason than slope. Subtraction is not commutative:
            <m>3 - 7 \neq 7 - 3</m>. But <em>squaring removes the sign</em>:
            <m>(3-7)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16 = (4)^2 = (7-3)^2</m>. So it genuinely
            does not matter which point comes first in the distance formula.</p>

            <p>Notice the crucial difference from slope and distance: midpoint
            uses <em>addition</em>, not subtraction. This is an <em>absolute</em>
            comparison — where the midpoint is depends on where the actual
            points are, not just on their relative position. Move both points
            10 units to the right and the midpoint moves too.</p>

            <p>Now we connect slope to the equation of a line. Start with the slope
            formula, but replace the second point <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> with the
            variable point <m>(x, y)</m>:</p>

            <me>y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)</me>

            <p>This is the <term>point-slope formula</term>. It is not named on the

            <m>PQ</m></q>. It says: if you know <em>one fixed point</em> and the
            <em>slope</em>, you can write the equation of the line.</p>
